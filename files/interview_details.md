## Grammar structures

Did you notice which grammar structures would be useful in the question *Where do you see yourself in five years?*? 

- You can use the **present simple** to discuss general facts about yourself, like your passions, interests, or motivations. 

- You can use the **past simple** to share work experiences and anecdotes that happened within a finished time period (such as Last year, in 2015, when I was younger, etc.).

- Use the **present perfect** when you talk about work experiences without mentioning a specific time.


What grammar structures did you notice in these responses to the question *Can you tell me about a long-term project that you managed and how you managed it?*

- The structure **“used to” + verb** can help you begin a story and provide context for the interviewer.

- Use the **past simple** (I worked there), **past continuous** (I was working there.), and **past perfect continuous** (I had been working there) for telling stories and anecdotes in the past.


Did you happen to notice which grammar structures would be useful here in the question *Why shouldn’t we hire you?*? 

- Use the **conditional tense** to talk about hypothetical or unreal situations. 

- You should also review **modal verbs** like might and may for the same purpose.

## What questions should you ask your interviewer?

Just because the interviewer has asked you all their questions doesn’t mean the interview is over. Here comes the final test: 

Here are a few examples:

- When did you start with the company?

- What do you enjoy most about working here?

- What is the company culture like?

- How do you onboard new employees? 

- Are there opportunities for personal development here?

- How would you describe your ideal candidate?

- What are the biggest challenges for someone in this position?

- Are there any new projects, products, clients, or plans for growth?

Asking the interviewer questions shows that you’ve done research about the company and you’re excited about the job. It also allows you to get a sense of the company atmosphere, where the company’s going, and if it’s the right fit for you. But don’t ask too many questions! It might show that you don’t know much about the company or that you don’t trust them. 

So, when the interview is over, what do you do? Breathe, send a follow-up email a couple of days later, and have a glass of wine. Take some time to reflect on the positive and negative moments of the interview, and see how you can improve for the next one.
